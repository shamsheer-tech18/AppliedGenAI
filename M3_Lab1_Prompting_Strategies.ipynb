        "Through this hands-on lab course, I have learned that, the way we frame the questions in prompt to a LLM does matters a lot just as much as the question itself. For simple problem, a zero-shot prompts can works best, if the questions are basic, for complex problems techniques like the CoT, Self-consistency will helps the model to be able to reason more effectively.\n",
